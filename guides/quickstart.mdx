<Step title="Create your company account">
To get started, visit [equisettle.twosvn.co.uk](https://equisettle.twosvn.co.uk) and click **Sign Up**.  
You can register your company using your business email and basic details.

Once your account is created, you’ll land on your company dashboard — where you can manage invoices, payments, and customers.

<Step title="Generate your API key">
 Head to **Settings → API Access** in your dashboard.  
Click **Generate API Key** — this key authenticates your company when calling Equisettle’s API.

<Note>
  Keep your API key safe. It provides access to your company’s A/R data and
  should never be shared publicly.

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
