The Equisettle API is organized around **REST** principles.  
It provides predictable, resource-oriented endpoints, uses standard HTTP verbs and response codes, and returns **JSON-encoded** responses.

## Base URL

All API requests are made over **HTTPS** from the following base domain:

`https://api.equisettle.com/v1/`

The general structure of a request looks like:

`https://api.equisettle.com/v1/:resource`

All request and response bodies are in **JSON** format.

## Authentication

Every API request must include your company’s **API key** for authentication.  
You can find your API key under **Developers → API** in your Equisettle dashboard.

Include it in the `Authorization` header like so:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.equisettle.com/v1/invoices" \
  -H "Authorization: API-Key YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Note>
  Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key. Keep this key secure — it
  provides access to your company’s data
</Note>

If your API key is missing or invalid, the API will respond with:

```json
{
  "error": "Access Denied",
  "message": "Invalid API Key."
}
```

## Checking API status

You can quickly verify that the Equisettle API server is active by pinging the root or status endpoint.

Example

```bash
curl https://api.equisettle.com
```

Response

```bash
Hello from Equisettle
```

Or check the health status:

```bash
curl https://api.equisettle.com/status
```

Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```
